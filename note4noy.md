#This is open letter
    To: Polet Noy Maimon
    From: Yury Tvardovsky

In response to your demand to treat you as grown-up.

First:
I'm deeply applologizing for not treating you this way from the start,
that is entirely my fault and I'll do my best to avoid it in future.

Second:
So far you have failed to act like responsible flatmate, therefor I made
following list for you, in case you'll want to change your acting toward
the people you're living with.

Basic traits of a responsible person includes:
- being nice to your peers
- sharing fairly
- respecting privacy
- keeping property in good order
- avoiding situations which may put at risk well-being and lives of other

Let me brake it down for you.

### being nice to your peers

Is about maintaining civil conversation or exiting it in a polite way. Your
way of responding to simple request by shouting, crying and resorting to
accusations is not civil in any way. To avoid this I'm switching to wrigting,
but that is also my last attempt to establish civil communication with you.
Please take to the account this doesn't have to be my problem in the first
place.

This is also about respecting your peers. That being said, if your current
arrangement gets in the way of acting responsibly - you are not excused. And
should choose between keeping the arrangement, or your flatmates. Every
adult person facing the same challenges and dealing with it.

### sharing fairly

Is not in any way about other people eating your spoils-to-be groceries.

Is about being aware, in shared areas, that you're not only one who using
the space and facilities. Which leads us to two things:
- cleanliness - to clean after yourself, not making someone cleans after
you because he simply cannot use the facility without doing so, and not 
offending others with trashy look and smell
- tidiness - not leaving personal items where they don't belongs (also
not asking people to move your personal items - see next section), and
not putting decoration when it can comlpicates simple tasks (like opening
drawer, or seeing things because of dimmed light)

You can find some suggestion for dealing with this matter below.

### invaiding privacy

This is about barging into my room without invitation throwing garbage in my
face (for which case I have a proper doorlock now, but still will like to hear
appologies of some sort for the past event), and pushing stuff beneath the
door (use fridge magnets for Christ's sake).

Also goes for asking someone to move your personal items when you clearly
could do it by yourself.

### keeping property in good order

Now, when I know how two previous stoves was destroed - because it wasn't
production defect but your ignorance about basic operation safety and
inability to read manual (or google it), I'm going to compensate the seller
540 shekels.

Because of this, until this matter is sorted, I ask you not to use any of my
stuff. That includes washer, stove, frying pan and knife. Also you either
giving me 30 shekels and using the pot as your own, or taking same 30 from
me and not using it like other things I listed.

Using kettle and wather filter is ok by now.

Sorting this out includes:
  1. complete compensation of caused damages (which is 700 shekels, because it
includes 160 for our current stove, already damaged, and not the one I bougth
for the owner - I'll have to compensate him also)
  2. reading operation manual for the thing you like to use, and explaining to me
what you make of it

Also be advised of two important things:
- turning on air-conditioner while outside temperature lower than +8C may
damage it
- when temperature hits 0C boiler have to be working and wather dripping
somewere. otherwise boiler or tubes can be destroyed by ice

### avoiding situations which may put at risk well-being and lives of other

That goes to night-time cooking, which you promice not to perform after the
unfortunate acident when you start cooking and fall asleep. Promice you broke
twice already without saying anything or proposing any measures to avoid same
acident from happening ever again. And this is just unacceptable.

Also goes to inviting in shady characters, as punks, thiefs and drug dealers.
This is actual threat to my well-being, because this very appartment is registered
in my name, and it makes me responsible for any criminal activity on the premises.
Make the owner change it to your name and you can have any kind of skum you like.

Moreover it raises a question if you can account for all your keys, and be sure
noone made a copy? Whith all this "I lost it days ago" I'm extremely skeptical.
This is calls for changing the lock, and can be discussed separately.

#### Here is some suggestion for clean floor:
- we actually don't need you to clean it, especially because you always leave it
half-way done. and the ammounts of cleaning solution you're using is hurting my
nose. so we can deal with it, and only need from you not to spread dirt on it.
- your flowers is a source of filth. not by themselfes, but because how you treat
them and not cleaning afterwards. the obvious solution is to move them to your room.
- same goes for smoking, because filters and tobacco gets everywere, and I already
asked you not to leave trays outside your room.
- and please stop wearing street shoes inside. I know this is not common in Israel,
but it will helps tremendously.

#### Here is a suggestion for kitchen:
- don't leave pots and frying pans on the stove after cooking is finished
- don't leave mess, dishes or kitchenware on the kitchen table
- scrub leftovers to the trash before putting anything into the sink
- do your dishes in short time and before it reaches half deepth of the
sink

Alternatively:
- use your own kitchenware and leave it in your room

#### Here is some general ones:
- please remove all personal items and decorations from the common area - it gets in
the way and steals precious space
